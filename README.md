# @bits.ts
![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@bits.ts/all)

Welcome to my personal monorepo of all the re-usable TypeScript components I am tired of re-coding for each project! For now, everything is made available as the npm package `@bits.ts/all`, but down the road if some of the submodules become useful in isolation, I will likely publish `@bits.ts/http`, `@bits/twitch`, etc.

# Installation
```bash
$ npm i @bits.ts/all
```

# YAGNI Disclaimer
In order for me to ever get anything done ever, I am taking an aggressive "Ya Ain't Gonna Need It" approach to which features/components I add to this repo.  It only contains the components I have needed to build for my use cases, so don't be shocked if it lacks something you can't live without -- I just haven't needed it! (yet)
